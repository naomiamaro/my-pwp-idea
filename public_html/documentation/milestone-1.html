<h1 >Bullet Journal/Blog</h1>

<p>This is one of the websites I wanted to make, because like most perfectionists on this planet, I like to organize, plan,
    and journal my life out. I have tried planners, calendars, agendas, journal books, and diaries. Yet to no avail I
    could not make them work for me. I had even tried a plain 'ol notebook to sort out my day. I then came across Bullet
    Journaling, which is the best of both worlds, maybe even more so. So I tried it. But unfortunately, my OCD kicked in
    and when I tried to create it I either hated my handwriting or hated the detailing I drew into it. So I thought maybe
    with a little help from the computer I could easily fix the problem. I could create a template, incorporate designs,
    have consistent font, and even have a spot with perfect sized font to journal how the day went.

<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>I believe this website will help me to learn the design part of coding. Maybe even get my hand into App development,
    and Graphic Design. I do believe that this project will motivate me to work, and develop my skills a little better.

<h2>Audience:</h2>
<p>To help poor individual souls like myself who want to journal, and keep a planner without the hassle multiple journals,
    hand cramps, creativity blocks, and most importantly not wanting to tear your hair out because nothing is working out.
    But alo for those who might not have the hand for doodling, and scribbling out their journals. A space for those who
    can't afford the stickers, pens, markers, washi tapes, and journals.

<h2>Goal:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Goal 1</strong>, succeed in this class to the best of my abilities, maybe even more.</li>
    <li><strong>Goal 2</strong>, to get a decent job at a decent place of employment.</li>
    <li><strong>Goal 3</strong>, to go back to school and further develop my knowledge.</li>
    <li><strong>Goal 4</strong>, to develop either a game or app.</li>
    <li><strong>Goal 5</strong>, the most important one, is to use these skills to make a living with; whether it's just
        for myself, or for others.</li>
