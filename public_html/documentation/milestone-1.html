<h1 style="text-align: center;">Bullet Journal/Blog</h1>
<p>----------</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong>     I enjoy mapping out my day, making schedules, and journaling to keep my mental health in check. Unlike those who
    can, I unfortunately can't seem to make it work on a regular "Day Planner", nor journal in a diary. Bullet Journals
    are absolute fun, they take the "over-minimalistic" design of a planner and add a touch of chaos, but in a fun organized
    manner. I have major OCD, can be quite the perfectionist, and am 2 pennies short of a dollar when it comes to my wallet. So this is where
    the website idea comes in handy. It gives people like me who have 2 seconds of  <em>PERFECT</em>  handwriting, and
    then tears out paper, after paper to get things perfect. Or have mountains of stationery supplies.
    It also serves as both "Diary" and "Day Planner".</p>
<p>-----------</p>
<p><strong>Audience:</strong>     For people who want to organize parts of their life that they are able to, and care for their mental health.
    Without the troubles, junk, OCD, and other issues when it comes to creating your own Bullet Journal.</p>
<p>-----------</p>
<p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>To create a space where I can organize things in my life that I have control over, and help those who can't
            afford to do the same.</li>
        <li>To one day create an App, and to dabble further into Application Development.</li>
        <li>To further develop my skills in Graphic Design, and create new, exciting, interactive websites/apps.</li>
    </ol>
