<h1 style="text-align: center;">Recipe Book/Blog</h1>
<p>----------------</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong>  I have a lot of reasons why I thought to make a website like this, and the main reasons
    are I love to cook. I love learning everything there is to know about cooking and baking. I wanted a website where
    I can be my own food critic, while also learning to cook different dishes, and baked goods. To share my experiences
    and personal recipes with others who also have things to share.</p>
<p>----------------</p>
<p><strong>Audience:</strong>  The audience this website is intended for is those who are like me, who love food,
    cooking, and baking. This website will help those who want to share recipes, tips, tricks, and be a food critic
    and share restaurant experiences.</p>
<p>----------------</p>
<p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>To become a part of a community that shares a love of food.</li>
        <li>To be hired to create for future employers who want to build websites similar to this, possibly better
            than what I've created.</li>
        <li>To bring even more enjoyment to a very special hobby that I love, and share with those who feel the same.</li>
        <li>To maybe one day stick my hand in Application Development, and turn this into an app or an idea similar to it.</li>
    </ol>
