<h1 style="text-align: center;">Recipe Book/Blog</h1>
<p>This is another website I found to be interesting, and exciting to make. I love to cook more than anything.
    Food is life, and for a food appreciator this website will come in handy. I am not an expert when it comes to cooking,
    but I do appreciate learning different recipes, especially family recipes. I also love learning different types of
    kitchen and cooking tips, and tricks. If you've ever been on a food blog to obtain a recipe you will have noticed
    that you have to get over a mountain of storytelling to get to the recipe. That's when my idea comes in, I would like
    to keep that aspect of food blogs, but without having to spend 6 hours reading the same thing over and over again for
    one recipe. The website will put the recipe first; it would also have links on how to do certain things like knife
    tips and tricks, how-to-instructions, etc..
    Then at the end limit the story behind how you created the dish. I would also put in a "critique" area, where others
    like myself can give helpful tips, or opinions on the dish.

<h2>Purpose:</h2>

<p>To help, and encourage those who appreciate food to continue cooking, and learning how to make healthy, exquisite
    meals at home.</p>
<p>---------</p>

<h2>Audience:</h2>

<p>The target audience would be for fellow food-lovers, food critics, and people who love to cook. I do think this website
    will be tailored to everyone, not just one small circle of people.</p>
