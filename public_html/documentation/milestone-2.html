    <p>The homepage will be simple. To go to a recipe you will just click on a photo and learn how to make the recipe.
    The main focus of the webpage will be the photo's. I'll add some text making it clear to them that they can click
    on the photo, which will take them to the recipe.</p>

    <p>Once you click on the photo of the recipe you want, it will scroll you down to the webpage, which will have the recipe
    on it. It will include a recipe list, and the amount of time it takes to make it.</p>

    <p>This image is the mobile app. It will look similar to the website. It will include a website, but not a header/
    navigation bar. The title will be a button that you can click to go back to the homepage. Similar to the website
    to get a recipe you just have to click on the photo you want to cook, and voila!</p>
